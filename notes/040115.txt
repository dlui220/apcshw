setup
  put x,y on frontier
while (if not empty) (
  current  remove 1st item from frontier;
  for each unvisited neighbor N of current:
     mark N as visited
     add N to frontier
     if N is exit then exit

=======================================

as you put nodes on the frontier
you can track in the node

put them on another data structure

========================================

make a 2nd 2-dimensional array (of coordinates)
