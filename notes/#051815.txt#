hashing / hasing tables
- you want to store data in a table (array) by some unique ID
- a hash function is a mapping that takes an id and converts 
  it into a table index
- ex. ID is OSIS #
      h(x) = x % 10000
better might be:
       h(x) = (product of all non-zero digits in x) % 10000 (always % tablesize)

When multiple IDs hash to the same table index we have a collision or clash
-> Your hash table must be large enough so that it is sparsely populated
-> Try to have a good hash function, one that distributes our IDs all over the
   array
